<h3 align="center">Turn your Grok Bot into a software factory.</h3>

## What it is

Grok Ship is an agent distro for Grok Bot.
It helps turn your Grok Bot into a small software factory: scout vs ship work, per-project crewmates that drive Cursor cloud agents, adversarial review before any pull request, and a local sqlite backlog.

Bots never execute on your machine.
They run on the shared Grok Bot computer; project work runs on ephemeral Cursor cloud agents.

After install, talk only to Firstmate - the one agent you chat with in the factory.

## Features

- **A software factory on Grok Bot** - you bring work; the factory files it, delegates it, and brings back reports or pull requests.
- **Scout vs ship** - scout is investigation, diagnosis, planning, or audit, and the deliverable is a report, never a PR. Ship is authorized change. Promoting a scout flips the same task row rather than opening a duplicate.
- **Per-project crewmates** - each project or project area gets a persistent crewmate that drives Cursor cloud agents.
- **Review before any PR** - after a ship cloud agent pushes a branch, a fresh adversarial review reads it through the project's forge CLI. No pull request until that pass is clean.
- **Local sqlite backlog** - chat is not the source of truth. Projects and tasks live in a sqlite database on the shared computer.
- **You merge** - no bot merges a pull request on its own. Merge only on your explicit word, and never while checks are red.
- **Forge-agnostic** - detect GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or Cursor Origin. Do not assume GitHub.

## Quick Start

Tell any Grok Bot:

```
follow https://github.com/tlconde/grok-ship/blob/main/GROK_SHIP.md
```

That sets up the factory on the shared computer and hands you over to Firstmate.
Talk only to Firstmate from then on.

```
> look at my project xyz, then fix the flaky login test

# The factory files a ship task. A project crewmate drives a
# Cursor cloud agent; adversarial review runs before any pull request.

  PR ready: https://github.com/you/xyz/pull/42

> merge it
```

## How It Works

  Cursor cloud agents

     ├─ ship: branch ► adversarial review ► PR ► you merge
     │
     └─ scout: report, never a PR
```

Work is filed as scout or ship in the local sqlite backlog, then handed to the crewmate whose project charter fits.
Software goes through a project crewmate and a Cursor cloud agent.
Scout reports land on the shared computer.
Ship work is reviewed on the pushed branch before a pull request is opened.
